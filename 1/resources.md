# Other resources

The internet is full of amazing resources for learning how to program, and specifically for learning how to program in JavaScript. This is not a complete list, just an indication of a few good options.

__If you find a resource you think should be shared with the class, please notify the instructor (via email, an Issue on this repository, or even a Pull request) to have it added.__

## p5

- [Code! Programming with p5](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) - A brilliant series of video lectures by Daniel Schiffman, covering many of the same topics as this course. A great source of reinforcement learning.
- [p5 Reference](http://p5js.org/reference) - All the key information about what p5 can do
- [p5 Examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) - Examples of what p5 can do

## JavaScript

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - A website devoted to learning to code, with excellent courses in JavaScript (as well as HTML, CSS, and more). A little dry, but very thorough.
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Another website for learning to code, with good coverage of JavaScript. Again, not arts-oriented, but solid.
